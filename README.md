Challenge #1: Playing with the elevator
        
        ~~ created basic outline ~~
        
Challenge #2: Built somewhat of an elevator

Challenge #3: Touched up flawed logic from Challenge #2 to process faster

Challenge #4...: Adjusted for multiple elevators and added event handler logic to make traversing floors more efficient

~~this working elevator also passed challenges 5-9 (90% of the time), to make it work 100% of the time I would need to adjust my queue method to be more efficient.~~
